# Python Code Snippets for Discrete Mathematics Course

![specialization logo](notebooks/images/logo_specialization.png)

This repository contains Python code snippets from the [Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science specialization at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics) and its [accompanying textbook](http://discrete-math.tilda.ws/). Together with interactive puzzles in the specialization, these interactive code snippets will give you a deeper understanding of the underlying ideas. To run them, you don't need to install or configure anything on your machine. Click the badge to invoke the notebooks in the cloud:

#### [Proofs: Convincing Arguments](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexanderskulikov/discrete-math-python-scripts/blob/master/notebooks/01_proofs_convincing_arguments.ipynb)

Why are some arguments convincing while others are not? What makes an argument convincing? How can you establish your argument in such a way that no room for doubt is left? How can mathematical thinking help us deal with this? In this section, we will start by digging into these questions. Our goal here is to learn by examples how to understand proofs, how to discover them on your own, how to explain them, and — last but not least — how to enjoy them: we will see how a small remark or a simple observation can turn a seemingly non-trivial question into one with an obvious answer.

#### [Finding an Example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexanderskulikov/discrete-math-python-scripts/blob/master/notebooks/02_finding_an_example.ipynb)

How can we know that an object with certain properties exists? In the previous chapter, we saw that it suffices to give an example of such an object, but finding an example might be a hard problem. One way to find an example is to go through all objects and check whether at least one of them meets the requirements. However, in many cases, the search space is enormous. A computer may help, but some reasoning that narrows the search space is important both for computer search and for “bare hands” work. In this chapter, we will learn various techniques for showing that an object exists and that an object is optimal among all objects (say, the smallest or largest object that meets the requirements).
